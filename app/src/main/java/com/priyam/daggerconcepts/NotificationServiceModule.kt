 * Qualifiers - @Named
 Since, NotificationServiceModule was confused between service and message class
 as both belong to NotificationService.

So, if in case objects of 2 or more classes of the same interface are being instantiated in the
module, we need to classify which specific class needs to be called using @Named annotation as qualifier.
